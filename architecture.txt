Blockchain (Smart Contract):
- Stores patient medical records (patientAddress, hospital, record, exams, medicines, patientInfo: height, wieght) 

- Include all kinds of medical records such as doctors prescriptions, medical history, laboratory reports, etc.
- In this usecase, only patient and registered hospital are the authorized entities for 
accessing the patients healthcare information and with the patients permission.

Backend:
- Node.js
- MongoDB: Stores sensitive data from patients (email,password,name,cpf,age,gender)

Frontend:
- React.js
- Web3.js: Interacts with ethereum smart contract which stores patient record (address,hospital,report,exams)

How it works:
The patient first registers with the Hospital in person by providing personal details (name, ID, age, gender).
Then when the patient goes to the doctor for the required treatment, the doctor can access and
register healthcare information of the patient. The information access and register are only 
possible if the patient gives the ID and set permission to the Hospital using the dApp.

Obs: Only the registered Hospitals can register new patients.
Obs2: Only doctors can register healthcare information about the patient.
Obs3: The patient name, id, gender and age are not stored on the Blockchain, this means that
theses infos are stored on a normal Data Base and only the permissioned Hospitals can access it.
Obs4: The healthcare infos are stored on the Blockchain, only patient and registered hospitals 
are the authorized entities for accessing the patients healthcare information and with the patients permission.
